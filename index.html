        <!-- Variable Types Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Variable Types</h2>
            <h3>Integer (int)</h3>
            <p>An integer is a whole number, e.g., 10, -5, 0.</p>
            <div class="console">Example: <code>x = 10</code></div>
            <h3>Float</h3>
            <p>A float is a number with a decimal point, e.g., 3.14, -2.71.</p>
            <div class="console">Example: <code>y = 3.14</code></div>
            <h3>Boolean (bool)</h3>
            <p>A boolean is either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p>
            <div class="console">Example: <code>is_sunny = True</code></div>
        </div>

        <!-- Loops Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <h3>While Loop</h3>
            <p>This loop is gonna run as long as a condition is true. Most of the 'while' loops we're gonna see in this unit is gonna be with 'counters' (or contadores in Spanish).</p>
            <p>Counters mean that we will increase a variable by +1 every time we run through the loop.</p>
            <div class="console">
                Example: <code>i = 0<br>while i &lt; 5:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("hi")<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i += 1</code>
            </div>
            <p>In the example, we increase 'i' by +1 every time we run through the loop until we reach 5; meaning our while loop will stop once 'i' becomes greater than 5.</p>
            <p><strong>Extra:</strong></p>
            <p>I haven't seen the teacher use this, but if he asks, you'll already know. There's something we call 'while true loops' or just infinite loops.</p>
            <div class="console">
                Example: <br><code>while True:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("hi")</code>
            </div>
            <p>In this case, we're looping while 'True'. Since True isn't a variable that we're ever gonna change, it will always stay True, meaning the loop will never stop.</p>
            <h3>For Loop</h3>
            <p>For loops iterate over a sequence. Oh shit, I forgot you're dumb asf, I'll make this sound easier for you.</p>
            <p>For loops are while loops but without the need of us having to increase a variable to keep track if it's higher than what's needed. Still not getting it?</p>
            <p>Maybe this is simpler: In for loops, you can set a specific amount of times a loop will repeat without the need of a variable that will increase every time we run through the loop. Stiiiiiiiiill not getting it? Well sucks, I don't find any other way to explain it rather than with examples:</p>
            <div class="console">
                Example: <br><code>for i in range(5):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(i)</code>
            </div>
            <p>In this example, 'i' is our temporary variable. Now, some questions you might have: What do u mean temporary? What's the difference between the 'i' in the while loop and this one?</p>
            <p>I'll answer both of 'em rn: I say temporary because this variable is only used for the loop, we're not setting it BEFORE the loop. Now the difference is that 'i' in the for loop is only there to keep track of the times we've repeated the loop. In the while loop, we normally have to increase it by +1 or check if the condition is True before running the loop again.</p>
            <div class="console">
                Example 2: <br><code>repetitions = int(input("Enter a number: "))<br>for i in range(repetitions):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(i)</code>
            </div>
            <p>In this case, we grab the user's input as an int (whole number), and we store it in the 'repetitions' variable. Then in the for loop, we use the 'repetitions' variable as our range (the times we will repeat it basically) and print 'i' the amount of repetitions the user input.</p>
            <p>Now, here's another thing you might notice in the for loop: Two numbers in the 'range' thing, like this: <code>for i in range(0, 6)</code>. This is very easy to understand though. The first number specifies where the loop will start, and the second number where the loop will end. Not getting it again? Figured bish. Here's an example:</p>
            <div class="console">
                Example 3: <br><code>for i in range(3, 6):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(i)</code>
            </div>
            <p>In this case, this would be our output:</p>
            <div class="console">
                <code>3<br>4<br>5</code>
            </div>
            <p>I hope you get it. If you don't, don't ask me, ask ChatGPT.</p>
            <p>"Oh, but why does it print until 5 and not 6???????" I got the ACTUAL explanation for you. I wish the teacher explained this, but he's too stupid to explain something so simple.</p>
            <p>The way Python indexes for loops is quite awkward, but it's better for actual people that program Python professionally. Here's the explanation anyways:</p>
            <p>This is the range function with the two parameters we know: <code>range(start, stop)</code>.</p>
            <p>Start is the number where the for loop will start from, and stop is the number it has to reach to stop looping. The function works in this way: The start value is included (starts from here), and the stop value is excluded (goes up to, but does not include this). This is what's happening with Example 3: <code>for i in range(3, 6)</code> prints 3, 4, and 5. It stops just before 6.</p>
